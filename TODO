* Add option to store open ffmpeg_movies as persistant resources. This will
  allow a script that returns frames as images to be called repeatedly
  without the performance hit of reopening the movie for each getFrame() call.

* Try to use av_seek_frame before reverting to sequential reads, this will speed
  up getFrame() on formats that support seeking.

* Add get audio bit rate function

* Add get audio channels function

* Decouple frame seek fuctionality from frame get functionality to allow 
  (at least internally) a gotoFrame function that will allow to count frames 
  manually since frame count as reported by ffmpeg is not always reliable.
