* Add error handler function with cleanup

* Add option to store open ffmpeg_movies as persistant resources. This will
  allow a script that returns frames as images to be called repeatedly
  without the performance hit of reopening the movie for each getFrame() call.

* Try to use av_seek_frame before reverting to sequential reads, this will speed
  up getFrame() on formats that support seeking.

* Add get audio bit rate function

* Add get audio channels function

* Resampling has been changed slightly due to a fix in recent versions
  of ffmpeg's resample code. Need to use EXPECTREX to test for both md5 
  possibilities in getFrameResampled regression.

* Add padding to getFrameResampled()

* Add ffmpeg_track object to encapsulate audio file specific methods
