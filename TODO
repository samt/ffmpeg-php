* Add option to config.m4 to -rpath path to ffmpeg libs.

* Add option to store open ffmpeg_movies as persistant resources. This will
  allow an script that returns frames as images to be called repeatedly
  without the performance hit of reopening the movie for each getFrame() call.

* Add option to resize (resample) the frame returned from getFrame(). This
  will use ffmpeg's resampling which is better than GDs and should speed up 
  a bit when returning say a thumbnail sized frame since less data has to
  be copied into the gd_image.

* Try to use av_seek_frame before reverting to sequential reads, this will speed
  up getFrame() on formats that support seeking.
