* Add option to config.m4 to -rpath path to ffmpeg libs

* Add option to store open ffmpeg_movies as persistant resources. This will
  allow an script that returns a single frame to be called repeatedly
  without the performance hit of reopening the movie for each getFrame() call.

* Add Constants for libavcodec version and build
