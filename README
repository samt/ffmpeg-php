PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
ffmpeg-php is an extension for php that adds useful functions for accessing and retrieving information from many of the video formats supported by ffmpeg.

WEBSITE:
The project website is at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-php/

NOTES:
ffmpeg-php was originally written to allow me to quickly tally the total duration of many small movie clips (>500 at a time). It's main advantage over shelling out to the command line version of ffmpeg is speed. There is setup and teardown overhead when repeatedly calling the commandline ffmpeg. ffmpeg-php currently supports gathering information on video files such as duration, framerate, framecount, width and height.

COMPATIBILITY
ffmpeg-php has been tested using PHP4.3.x and PHP5 on Linux/x86 so far. ffmpeg-0.4.9_pre1 or greater required. ffmpeg must be built as shared libs. I have been using the extension for some time in production, however the movies on my site are homogeneous (All .mov with rpza codec) and so the extension hasn't really be tested with a wide variety of codecs/formats. In my limited testing with other codecs and formats, I've noticed wmv/asf do not always return useful data for duration and framerate. This may be a limitation of the format, I don't know, but I've seen other ffmpeg based projects complain of this so the solution is probably outside the scope of this project.

SOURCES
Almost all of the code exists in ffmpeg.c. Regression tests are located in tests/
