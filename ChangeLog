    New Features:
    * Added PHP constants for libavcodec version and build numbers (tkirby)
    * Added getVideoBitRate() method (tkirby)
    * More optimizations for successive calls to getFrame() (tkirby)

    Bug Fixes

      them. (tkirby)
    * Return zero if can't get a valid duration for the movie (tkirby)
    * Zero out alpha channel when copying frame to GD so GD will not try to 
      apply alpha when image is passed to gdImageCopyResampled() (tkirby)
    * getFrame() no longer bounds checks the framenumber param against 
      framecount since framecount may not always be accurate. (tkirby)

      of generating an error. (tkirby)

    New Features:

      faster (tkirby)
    * getFrame() can now be called without an argument to get the next frame in
      the stream (tkirby)

    Bug Fixes:

      frame (tkirby)
