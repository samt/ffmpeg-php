INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

These instructions are for Linux since I don't have windows.

1. Unpack the archive and copy the ffmpeg extension directory into your the php sources extensions directory

        tar -xjf ffmpeg-php.X.XX.tar.gz
        cp ffmpeg /path/to/php-4.3.9RC1/ext

2. Build php if not already built (See the file INSTALL in your php source directory)

3. cd into the ffmpeg extension directory

        cd /path/to/php-4.3.9RC1/ext/ffmpeg

4. Run phpize to build configuration files

        phpize

4. Configure and build

        ./configure && make

5. Become root

        su root

6. Install the shared extension

        make install

7. Put the file tests/test.avi and tests/test_ffmpeg.php under your web root 
somewhere (put both in the same directory).

8. Load test_ffmpeg.php into your browser.

RESULTS: You should get a listing of the functions provided by the ffmpeg-php 
         module

NOTE: These instructions bulid ffmpeg-php as a shared library extension. You
must explicitly load it in your php script using dl(). If you want to install
ffmpeg-php as part of the php binary then add... 

        --with-ffmpeg=yes 
        
...to your php configure line and rebulid php. Alternately you can just add...

        extension=ffmpeg.so

...to your php.ini file to automatically load the shared extension when php is 
started.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

This INSTALL doc is very preliminary, I spent about 45 
seconds writing this and even less time testing it. If you get 
stuck, shoot me an email and I'll try to help.
