INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

These instructions are for Linux since I don't have windows. If you
successfully build on windows, let me know how you did it and I'll update 
the instructions.


BUILDING AS A SHARED EXTENSION 
------------------------------

1. Build php if not already built (See the file INSTALL in your php source directory)

2. Unpack the archive and copy the ffmpeg extension directory into your the 
   php sources extensions directory

        tar -xjf ffmpeg-php.X.XX.tar.gz
        cp ffmpeg /path/to/php_sources/ext

3. cd into the ffmpeg extension directory

        cd /path/to/php_sources/ext/ffmpeg

4. Run phpize (included in the php installation) to build configuration files

        phpize

5. Configure and build

        ./configure && make

6. Install the shared extension 

        make install (you may need to become root depending on your installation)

If everything went as planned, ffmpeg-php is now installed as a shared library. 
You must explicitly load it in your scripts using dl(ffmpeg.so) or if you want 
it available to all scripts by default add extension=ffmpeg.so to your php.ini 
file which will tell php to load it when starting up.


BUILDING AS PART OF THE PHP BINARY 
----------------------------------

1. Unpack the archive and copy the ffmpeg extension directory into your the php 
   sources extensions directory

        tar -xjf ffmpeg-php.X.XX.tar.gz
        cp ffmpeg /path/to/php_sources/ext

2. configure php using... 

        --with-ffmpeg=yes 
       
...and build and install php.

The ffmpeg functions should now be built directly into php and so no need to
explicitly load the extension at runtime.


TESTING THE INSTALLATION
------------------------

1. Put the directory test_media and test_ffmpeg.php script under your web root
somewhere (put both in the same directory).

2. Load test_ffmpeg.php into your browser.

RESULTS: You should get a listing of the methods provided by the ffmpeg-php 
         module as well as some test output from the methods.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

This INSTALL doc is not very comprehensive. If you get 
stuck, shoot me an email and I'll try to help.
