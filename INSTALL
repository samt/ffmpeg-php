INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

These instructions are for Linux since I don't have windows. If you successfully build on windows, let me know how you did it and I'll updated the instructions.

1. Unpack the archive and copy the ffmpeg extension directory into your the php sources extensions directory

        tar -xjf ffmpeg-php.X.XX.tar.gz
        cp ffmpeg /path/to/php_sources/ext

2. Build php if not already built (See the file INSTALL in your php source directory)

3. cd into the ffmpeg extension directory

        cd /path/to/php_sources/ext/ffmpeg

4. Run phpize to build configuration files

        phpize

5. Configure and build

        ./configure && make

6. Install the shared extension 

        make install (you may need to become root depending on your installation)

If everything went as planned, ffmpeg-php is now install as a shared library.


BUILDING AS PART OF THE PHP BINARY 
----------------------------------

NOTE: These instructions build ffmpeg-php as a shared library extension. You
must explicitly load it in your php script using dl(). If you want to install
ffmpeg-php as part of the php binary then add... 

        --with-ffmpeg=yes 
       
...to your php configure line (step 2) and rebuild php. Alternately you can just add...

        extension=ffmpeg.so

...to your php.ini file to automatically load the shared extension when php is 
started.


TESTING THE INSTALLATION
------------------------

1. Put the file tests/test.avi and tests/test_ffmpeg.php under your web root 
somewhere (put both in the same directory).

2. Load test_ffmpeg.php into your browser.

RESULTS: You should get a listing of the method provided by the ffmpeg-php 
         module as well as a very outdated test of some of the functions.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

This INSTALL doc is very preliminary, I spent about 45 
seconds writing this and even less time testing it. If you get 
stuck, shoot me an email and I'll try to help.
